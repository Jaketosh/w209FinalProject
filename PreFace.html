            <strong>What is a recession?</strong>
            <p>A period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters. </p>

            <p> Recessions can last months or event years.  During a recession, the economy struggles, people lose work, companies make fewer sales and the countryâ€™s overall economic output declines. The point where the economy officially falls into a recession depends on a variety of factors. </p>

            <p> In 1974, economist Julius Shiskin came up with a few rules of thumb to define a recession: The most popular was two consecutive quarters of declining GDP. A healthy economy expands over time, so two quarters in a row of contracting output suggests there are serious underlying problems, according to Shiskin. This definition of a recession became a common standard over the years.</p>
