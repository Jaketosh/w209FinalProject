<div class="chartExplaination">
    The U-Shaped curve is defined by prolonged periods of GDP contraction followed by a slower recovery that eventually returns to trend growth.
    Due to their slower nature, U-Shaped recessions tend to last longer than V-shaped recessions. An example of a U-shaped recession is The Recession  
    of 1973-1975 in the United States.
