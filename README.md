### Description
This website focuses on educating users on the basics of recessions and gives the users an opportunity to compare what they have learned to our current (COVID Era) economic state. We focused on using a storytelling approach to attempt to keep users engaged and not overwhelm them with information or data that some might consider dry and uninteresting. The website begins by introducing users to what recessions are and how recessions can vary in intensity. They are then led to the section where they can learn about different types of recession curves and can compare different recession curves to each other and to our current economic data. Users then will learn about standard economic metrics and how those have changed throughout historical recessions. Finally users will learn about alternative measures and how those can be used to track recessions and recoveries.
