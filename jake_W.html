<h2 class = "jakeh2">W Shape</h2>
<div class="chartExplaination">
    The W-shaped curve is marked by a fall into recession followed by a short period of growth, a fall back, and then finally a recovery.
    This type of fluctuation creates a double-dip shape, or a "W" shape. W-shaped recessions also tend to be more prolonged than V-shaped.
    And example of a W-shaped curved is The Early 80's Recession in the United States.
