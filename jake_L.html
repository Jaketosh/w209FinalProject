    The L-shape recession occurs during a severe recession. It is defined by a steep decline in economic growth followed by a recovery where
    it takes years to return to trend line growth. L-shaped recessions are often referred to as "depressions." An example of an L-shape
    recession is The Late 2000s recession in the United States.
