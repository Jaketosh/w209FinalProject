<div class="chartExplaination">
    Recessions are often defined by the approximate shape the data takes on during the recession and its recovery.
    The most common curve is the V-shaped recession. A V-shaped curve is identifiable by a sharp, but brief, period of decline in GDP
    followed by an agressive recovery. An example of a V-shaped recession is The Recession of 1953 in the United States.
